# speed-Detector
### About The Project

1. This program takes as input the speed of a car e.g 80.
* If the speed is less than 70, it should print “Ok”.
* Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70),
 it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points
